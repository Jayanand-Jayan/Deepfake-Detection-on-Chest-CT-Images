# Deepfake-Detection-on-Chest-CT-Images

Medical Imaging is the non-invasive process of producing internal visuals of a body for the process of medical examination, analysis and treatment. Numerous attacks on clinics and hospitals occurred in 2018, resulting in serious data breaches and delays in medical services. When an attacker has access to medical records they are able to do far more than just demand a ransom or sell the information. One method to create deepfakes is to inject or remove tumours from medical images. Failure to recognise medical deepfakes might result in significant losses of hospital resources and even death. 
Hence, here is an attempt to build a machine learning model and train it to carry out detection between original images and deepfakes created and analyse them.
